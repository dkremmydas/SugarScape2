# SugarScape2

This is a full implementation of Sugarscape model ("Artificial World", Epstein & Axtell) in Java under the Repast Simphony framework.

It has a twofold purpose:
1. Show the virtues of using object oriented languages for social simulation
2. Provide code that can be easily modified and/or extended for exploring the sugar scape model

Presently chapter II is fully implemented. In the future Chapter IV will be also fully implemented.
