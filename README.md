# SugarScape2

This is a full implementation of Sugarscape model ("Artificial World", Epstein & Axtell) in Java under the [Repast Simphony framework](https://repast.github.io/).

It has a threefold purpose:

1. Present advanced features of Repast Simphony framework
2. Show the virtues of using object oriented languages for social simulation
3. Provide code that can be easily modified and/or extended for exploring the Sugarscape  model

Presently chapters 2 and 3 are fully implemented. Chapter 4 is under development.

Contributors are welcomed !

You can read more on using and extending the code in the [Wiki](https://github.com/dkremmydas/SugarScape2/wiki)
